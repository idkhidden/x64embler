# x64embler
x64embler is an ghetto x86-64 disassembler developed in C++. Initially intended as an educational project, this disassembler aimed to provide a basic mechanism for disassembling x86-64 instructions. However, I underestimated the complexity of creating a fully functional and efficient disassembler.
